# YAWA
Yet Another Wordle App

This is inspired by the Wordle game at (https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/).  My goal with this is to practice my VueJS skills.

I used Vite to set up the project, and built this using Vue 3 and TypeScript.

To serve the app:

1. `git clone https://github.com/adkinsrs/YAWA.git`.  This will clone the repository to your current directory.
2. `cd YAWA/YAWA`
3. `npm install`
4. `npm run dev`
